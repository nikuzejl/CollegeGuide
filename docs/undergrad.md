# Undergraduate Application

As you prepare your undergraduate application, keep the following in mind:

- You need to do well in your classes to stand out among thousands of applicants.  
- Grades are not everything — extracurricular activities help show that you're more than just a good student.  
- If English is not your native language, most schools will require an English language test.  
- Aim for scores higher than the minimum required in standardized tests.

## Documents You Might Need

- High school diploma  
- National exam scores  
- High school transcripts (usually the last three years)  
- Recommendation letters  

### English Language Tests

The most common test is **TOEFL**, which includes reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

Other accepted tests may include:

- [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/)  
- [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/home)

Some schools will also require standardized admission tests:

- [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)  
- [ACT](https://www.act.org/)

If you cannot take these tests, consider applying to schools (mainly **community colleges**) that do not require standardized tests.



## Admission and Financial Aid

You must apply and be admitted before you are considered for scholarships.

Once admitted, you may receive financial aid directly from the university or through other organizations. Be sure to check the financial aid options on your school's website.

One example of external support is the [**MasterCard Foundation**](https://mastercardfdn.org/), which provides scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students across many countries.

You may also:

- Apply for a **student loan** (to be paid back after graduation)  
- **Self-fund** your education if you have the means  



## College Readiness Programs

If you can prepare for college on your own — that’s great! But if English or test preparation is a challenge, there are organizations that can help.
