# Undergraduate Application

As you prepare your undergraduate application, keep the following points in mind:

- Perform well in your classes to stand out among thousands of applicants.  
- Grades are important, but extracurricular activities demonstrate that you are more than just a good student.  
- If English is not your native language, most schools will require you to take an English language proficiency test.  
- Aim to score higher than the minimum requirements on standardized tests.

## Documents You Might Need

- High school diploma  
- National exam scores  
- Standardized test results  
- Essays and personal statements submitted as part of your application  
- High school transcripts (usually the last three years)  
- Letters of recommendation  

### English Language Tests

As a Burundian, or from another country where English is not your mother tongue, you will likely need to pass an English proficiency test that assesses reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. Be sure to check which test your chosen schools require. Most universities accept one of the following:

- [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/home)  
- [TOEFL](https://www.ets.org/toefl)  
- [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/)  

Some schools may also require the [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat) or [ACT](https://www.act.org/).

## Admission and Financial Aid

You must apply and be admitted before you can be considered for scholarships. Focus first on preparing a strong student application, as this is the most challenging part of the process. The university must see you as a good fit to consider you for scholarships. Simply put, university admission must come before scholarship consideration.

Possible sources of funding include:

- Financial aid offered directly by the university or through other organizations. Check your school’s website for financial aid options.  
- Scholarships or funding from organizations, such as the [**MasterCard Foundation**](https://mastercardfdn.org/).  
- **Self-funding** your education if you have the means.  
- Applying for a **student loan** to be repaid after graduation (note: this is almost impossible for international students).  
- Currently, the government of Burundi does not typically provide scholarships for study in the U.S. or Canada but does offer scholarships for other countries.
