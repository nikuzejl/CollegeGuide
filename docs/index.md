# Applying to University in the U.S.

Applying to university in a foreign country can be daunting. However, thousands of international students succeed every year — and you can too!

This site provides basic information about the American university application process for both undergraduate (*baccalauréat ou licence*) and graduate (*master ou doctorat*) studies.

## About the American Higher Education System

In the U.S., bachelor's programs typically last four years, master's programs one to two years, and Ph.D. programs four to six years.

Unlike many other countries, you cannot enter medical school directly from high school. First, you must earn a four-year bachelor's degree in any major (*faculté*) before applying to medical school, which then lasts four years. The same process applies to dental, veterinary, and law schools.

In the U.S., students are not required to declare a major until their second year of university. It’s perfectly fine to start university undecided. You can even pursue multiple majors or minors at no extra cost.



## Differences and Similarities: University, College, and Community College

- **University**: Offers both undergraduate (bachelor's) and graduate (master's and/or Ph.D.) degrees.
- **College**: Offers only undergraduate degrees. You can earn a bachelor’s degree at either a college or a university. In the U.S., the terms "college" and "university" are often used interchangeably.
- **Community College**: Offers 2-year associate degrees. You can later transfer to a college or university to pursue a bachelor's degree or higher.

In the U.S., the terms "college" and "university" are often used interchangeably, and their tuition costs are usually similar.



## Financial Aid

American universities are known for being expensive. Unless you are wealthy or willing to take out loans, you’ll likely need financial aid.

Make sure the universities you're applying to offer scholarships to international students. Admission is the first critical step — most schools will only consider you for financial aid once you've been admitted.

Many international students receive need-based scholarships.



## Where Should You Start the Application Process?

- Research universities that offer majors you're interested in.
- Review the university's website for application requirements, especially standardized test and language requirements for international students.
- If you need a scholarship, check if the university offers aid to international students.
- Prepare for and take standardized tests (e.g., SAT, GRE, TOEFL).
- Gather all necessary documents.
- Submit your applications and stay hopeful!

To improve your chances, apply to multiple universities. Don’t hesitate to contact admissions offices or talk to current students or alumni for advice.
