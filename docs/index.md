### Introduction

Applying to a university in a foreign country can be daunting. However, thousands of international students succeed every year — and you can too!

This site provides a basic overview of the university application process in the U.S. and Canada for both undergraduate and graduate studies. It is a simplified guide and **not** exhaustive. For more detailed information, further research will be necessary.

This guide is written with Burundian students in mind, but students from other countries may also find it helpful. It also includes some information about other immigration programs that may be of interest.


### About the American Higher Education System

In the U.S. and Canada:
- **Bachelor’s programs** typically last four years.
- **Master’s programs** usually take one to two years.
- **Ph.D. programs** often take four to six years.

In the U.S., students are not required to declare a major until their second year of university. It’s perfectly acceptable to begin university undecided. In fact, you can often pursue multiple majors or minors without additional tuition costs.

### Financial Aid

Higher education in North America can be expensive. Unless you are financially well-off, you’ll likely need financial aid. Be sure to apply to universities that offer scholarships to **international students**.

Admission is the first critical step — most schools will only consider you for financial aid after you’ve been admitted.

Many international students receive **need-based** scholarships and other forms of financial aid.


### Visa Application

Once you're admitted to a university and have secured proof of funding and other required documents, you can apply for a **student visa**.

### Where Should You Start?

Here’s a step-by-step approach to get started:

- Research universities that offer the majors you're interested in.
- Check each university’s website for application requirements, especially standardized test and language requirements.
- If English is not your native language, and you're applying to an English-speaking school, you’ll likely need an English proficiency test (e.g., **Duolingo English Test**, **TOEFL**, **IELTS**).
- If you need a scholarship, verify whether the university offers aid to international students.
- Prepare for and take required standardized tests (e.g., **SAT**, **GRE**, **TOEFL**).
- Gather all necessary documents (e.g., transcripts, recommendation letters, personal statements).
- Submit your university applications — and stay hopeful!
- To increase your chances, apply to multiple universities.
- Reach out to admissions offices or connect with current students or alumni for insights and support.
- Once admitted, apply for a visa.
- Start preparing for your new academic journey!

The whole process can seem lengthy and challenging—it’s not easy. Luckily, you don’t have to do it alone. There are programs that can help you learn English, pass tests, and support you throughout the entire journey. You can [find them here.](/uni-guide/college-readiness-programs/)
