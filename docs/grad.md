## Applying to Graduate School

To apply to graduate school, you will typically need:

- Your university transcript  
- Letters of recommendation  
- A statement of purpose and/or personal statement  
- Any other essays required by the program you are applying to  

### Key Tips to Strengthen Your Application

- **Participate in undergraduate research** — it greatly strengthens your application, especially for research-based programs.  
- **Maintain strong grades** — they demonstrate your readiness for graduate-level coursework.  
- **Get involved outside the classroom** — volunteering, internships, or work experience all help.  
- **Have a clear academic goal** — unlike undergraduate programs, graduate schools expect you to know exactly what you want to study.  
- **For Ph.D. programs**, familiarize yourself with current research at your target universities and, if possible, contact professors in your field of interest.  
- **As a Burundian (or any international student whose first language is not English)**, you will likely need to take an [English test](/uni-guide/english-tests/).  
- **Some programs** may also require additional standardized tests such as the [GRE](https://www.ets.org/gre/), though this is not always mandatory.


## Admission and Financial Aid

You must be **admitted before you can be considered for scholarships**. Your priority should be to prepare a strong application — this is the most challenging and most important part. Universities will only consider you for financial aid if they believe you're a good fit for the program.

### Financial Aid Options

While there are generally fewer need-based scholarships for graduate students than undergraduates, **many graduate schools offer some form of funding**. Your options may include:

- **University financial aid or assistantships** — Many master’s programs offer **teaching assistantships (TAs)** or **research assistantships (RAs)** that cover tuition and may include a stipend.  
- **External scholarships and grants** — from organizations such as the [**MasterCard Foundation**](https://mastercardfdn.org/).  
- **Self-funding** — if you or your family have the financial means.  
- **Student loans** — although these are very difficult to obtain as an international student.  
- **Government funding** — Currently, the **Burundian government** does not usually provide scholarships for study in the U.S. or Canada, but may offer funding for study in other countries.  
- **Ph.D. programs** — Most are **fully funded**, meaning tuition and living expenses are typically covered through research funding or assistantships.
