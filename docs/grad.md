# Graduate School

To apply to graduate school, you will need:

- Your university transcript  
- Two or three recommendation letters  
- Statement of purpose  
- Personal statement  
- Other essays required by the program you are applying to  


Here are some other facts to keep in mind as you prepare your application:

- Doing research during your undergraduate studies will strengthen your graduate school application.
- Strong undergraduate grades show that you are capable of handling graduate-level coursework.
- Be active outside the classroom — volunteering, work experience, internships all help.
- Unlike undergraduate school, you should clearly know what you want to study.  
  For Ph.D. programs, you should be aware of ongoing research at your target universities and, if possible, contact professors in your area of interest.
- Some schools may require the **GRE** exam. [Click here to learn more about the GRE](https://www.ets.org/gre/).


## Financial Aid

There are fewer need-based scholarships for graduate school than for undergraduate. However, most schools offer **some form of financial aid**.

- If you apply for a **Ph.D.**, your program is likely to be fully funded through research budgets, which typically cover tuition and living expenses.
- For **master’s programs**, you may qualify for a **teaching or research assistantship**, which can cover part or all of your expenses.
