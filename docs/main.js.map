It is time to attend university!\n      Your education will help you to learn new skills, grow as a person, \n      explore, be challenged, get a job.... It is important that you take\n      this next step seriously, have an open mindset and most importantly, \n      work hard to achieve your goals.\n    </p>\n      \n    <h2>A little bit about the North American education system</h2>\n    \n    The American and Canadian education systems are very similar. Bachelor's degrees are earned in four years, master's degrees 1-2 years and PhD 4-6 years.\n    In the United States or Canada, you cannot start medical school from your first year of university. You need to earn a bachelor's degree first, in any major, and then apply to medical school later, which usually lasts for 3 years. The process is the same for law school.\n    You are not required to declare a major until the second year of university, which means that is acceptable to be undecided when you start school. You can also have more than one major or minor during your 4 years of university without paying additional tuition.\n    Most universities are Liberal Arts schools but few of them are not.\n    \n    <h2>Beware of scams</h2> \n\n    Scammers know that you really want to study abroad. There are many frauds on the internet\n    and that is why you should make sure that your applications are submitted on official websites.You should be alarmed if scammers start asking for money or sensitive information.\n    \n    <h2> Universit vs college vs community college</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        A university is an institution which offers undergraduate degrees(bachelor's degrees) and \n        graduate degrees(master's degrees and/or PhD)\n      </li>\n\n      <li>\n        A college offers just bachelor's degrees. Therefore, you can get a bachelor's degree at either a college or a university. Moreover, the terms \"College\" and \"University\" are interchangeably\n        used in the United States\n      </li>\n      \n      <li>\n        A community college offers associate degrees. After finishing a community college, you can transit to a college or university\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    Sometimes, you might wanna apply to community college because their tution is usually lower than the univerisities and colleges. Moreover, most community colleges do not require any standardized tests (TOEFL, SAT,...).\n    Remember that you can always transfer to a college from a community college. There are public and private universities.\n    Private universities are most likely to offer scholarships to international students.\n  </p>\n    \n    There are public and private universities. Private universities are most likely to offer scholarships to international students.\n  \n  <h2>Application timeline</h2>\n    Schools have different application deadlines. For undergraduate applications, you can find the most common schedule here\n  \n  <h2>Financial aid</h2>  \n    Financial aid is very important because education is very expensive in the United States. \n    Scholarships are competitive, and that is why you need to work hard to get them.\n    Most schools will normally fund your education if they like you as a student. \n    Keep in mind that it does not matter if you show how miserable and poor you are without proving that, as a student, you are a good candidate for that particular school. Your main focus should be to present yourself as a good student. When you are admitted, it will not be hard to get financial aid. However, make sure that the schools you are applying to normally give financial aid.\n    \n    <h2>Before you start your application</h2>\n    Look up different schools which have the majors(\"facultés\") that you are interested in\n    Which parts of the country do you like the most? (East, West, cold or hot weather, \n    or you just don't care about those factors? )\n    What do you like about the institutions that you are applying to? (this will help in \n    your essays when you need to explain why you are a good fit for your school)\n    \n    Some of the documents that you will need for your application\n    If you apply for an undergraduate degree:\n    National exam scores\n    High school transcripts (usually the last three years)\n    Recommendation letters from your professors\n    If you apply for a graduate degree\n    \n    University transcripts\n    Recommendation letters from your professors\n    You will also need to write different essays such as personal statements or letters of motivation.\n\n<div class=\"degrees\" routerLink=\"/undergrad\">\n  <div class=\"degree\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n      Undergraduate (Bachelor's)\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"degree\" routerLink=\"/grad\">\n    <div class=\"text\">\n      Graduate (Master's and PhD)\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n ","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { MessageService } from 'src/app/services/message.service';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-footer',\n  templateUrl: './footer.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./footer.component.css'],\n  providers: [MessageService]\n})\nexport class FooterComponent {\n  contact_title= \"Contact us\";\n  subject= new FormControl();\n  message= new FormControl();\n  sent_message:boolean = false;\n\n  constructor(private messageService: MessageService){}\n\n  sendMessage(){\n    this.messageService.sendMessage(this.subject.value,this.message.value);\n    this.sent_message = true;\n  }\n\n  isValidInput(){   \n    return !(this.subject.invalid || this.message.invalid)\n  }\n}\n","<div class=\"container\">\n    <h2>About the author</h2>\n    I am Burundian, and I attended university in the USA.\n\n    You can leave me a message here if you have feedback or questions.\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"text\">\n    <br>\n    You can leave a message, and we will get back to you as soon as we can\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n    <form target=\"_blank\" action=\"https://formsubmit.co/nikuzejl@gmail.com\" method=\"POST\">\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_captcha\" value=\"false\">\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_subject\" value=\"Email from site visitors\">\n        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Your email address\" required>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" placeholder=\"Write your message here\" required>\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_next\" value=\"https://nikuzejl.github.io/\">\n        <button type=\"submit\"> Send</button>\n    </form>\n  </div>\n<!-- \n<div *ngIf=\"!sent_message\" id=\"form_n_button\">\n    <br> <br>\n    <mat-form-field>\n        <mat-label>Email</mat-label>\n        <input matInput [formControl]=\"subject\" type=\"email\" gModel email=\"true\" required>\n    </mat-form-field>\n\n    <br><br>\n\n    <mat-form-field>\n        <mat-label>Message</mat-label>\n        <input matInput [formControl]=\"message\" required>\n    </mat-form-field>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <div *ngIf=\"isValidInput()\">\n        <button id=\"valid_button\" (click)=\"sendMessage()\"> Send </button>\n    </div>\n\n    <div *ngIf=\"!isValidInput()\"> \n        <button id= \"invalid_button\"> Send </button>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div *ngIf=\"sent_message\" id=\"message_sent\" >\n    <br>\n    <b>Your message has been sent.

For example, the European Union offers fully funded master's programs in different countries\n            through a scholarship program called <a href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-masters-scholarships\">Erasmus</a>.\n            \n            <br> This is one example of \n            <a href= \"https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/burundi_fr/106231/Les%20candidatures%20individuelles%20aux%20masters%20d%E2%80%99excellence%20du%20Programme%20Erasmus+%20sont%20ouvertes%20\"> announcement of scholarship offer in 2021  </a> \n            <br> Another one for scholarships in the United Kingdom is <a href=\"https://www.chevening.org/scholarship/burundi/\"> Chevening</a>\n            \n      </p>\n\n  <h3>Admission first, the financial aid</h3>\n    <p> Admission or acceptance is different from a scholarship.\n     <p> If you want to get a scholarship from a university, you first apply as anybody else in order to get an admission. Most schools will ask you to complete a separate financial aid application in order to take care of your funding.\n     </p>\n      \n           <p> You may also get financial aid from another organization that accepts to cover your school fees. For example, the <a href= \"https://mastercardfdn.org/\"> MasterCard Foundation </a> gives scholarships to many African students who want to pursue their graduate studies in different countries around the world. In order to get the MasterCard scholarship, you apply to its partner universities in order to be admitted first. When you have a university admission, then you apply for funding to the MasterCard Foundation.\n     </p> \n  \n           <p>People get scholarships in so many different ways. The most common scholarships are provided by universities themselves or their partner organizations such as the MasterCard Foundation. You can also look for other organizations that can fund your education or reach out to the government of your country if it is willing to help you. Or if you are rich enough, you can just pay for yourself.\n     </p>\n\n     <p> Surprisingly enough, it is usually easier to get full scholarships for PhD programs than master's programs. If you feel like you want to have a career in research or academics, a PhD is a good way to go.\n      Just remember that it is a serious commitment of probably 5 years in school.\n     </p>\n\n     <p> At some universities, you can start a PhD program right after finishing your undergraduate degree, while others might require you do master's first and continue to PhD afterward.\n     </p>\n\n</div>\n\n","import { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NavigationEnd, Router } from '@angular/router';\nimport { AnalyticsService } from './analytics.service';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'CollegeGuide';\n  \n  constructor (\n    private readonly analyticsService: AnalyticsService,\n    private readonly router: Router,\n  ) { }\n  \n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.analyticsService.init();\n  \n    this.router.events.subscribe(event => {\n      if (event instanceof NavigationEnd) {\n        (window as any).ga('set', 'page', event.urlAfterRedirects);\n        (window as any).ga('send', 'pageview');\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n","<div class=\"container\">\n    <router-outlet></router-outlet> \n     \n    <app-footer></app-footer>\n</div>\n\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-undergrad',\n  templateUrl: './undergrad.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./undergrad.component.css']\n})\nexport class UndergradComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<div class=\"container\">\n  \n     <h2> Undergraduate degree application</h2>\n\n     <ul>\n      <li> I guess you either are still in high school or you are a recent graduate.
